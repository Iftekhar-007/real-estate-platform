## 🏠 Real Estate Platform

## 📌 Overview
This **Real Estate Platform** is a MERN stack web application designed for buying, selling, and managing properties online.  
It supports **three roles** — **User, Agent, and Admin** — each with its own dashboard and features.  
Users can explore verified properties, add them to their wishlist, make offers, and complete payments.  
Agents can list properties, manage offers, and interact with buyers, while Admins oversee verification, fraud detection, and platform management.
